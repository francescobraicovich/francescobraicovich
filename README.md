## Ciao everyone! üëã
- I am francesco (braico for friends)
- I study Maths for AI @ Bocconi University
- I currently am head of research/projects @ [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association)

## üìå Some Relevant Projects 

#### Research Oriented Projects

- `üß© ARC-AGI with Reinforcement Learning`: A novel framework to solve ARC-AGI tasks with sequential actions through RL.
  - [`ARC (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC.git): Designed a custom Domain Specific Language, action space and implemented Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for the large combinatorial space.  
  - [`ARC (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2.git): An improvement to v1, implemented learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with pretrained world model to ease action space navigation.  
  - `ARC (v3)`: Implementing a Hierarchical World Model for the RL agent to leverage during training and inference.
- [`üíß Drop-Stochastic Gradient Descent`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/dsgd.git): A new PyTorch optimizer that stochastically selects which parameters to update at each iteration. 
- [`üåç RL World Models`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/rl-worlds.git): Evaluating JEPA world model with VICReg against ViT Encoder-Decoder models on RL environments.  

#### Personal ML Projects

- [`üèéÔ∏è Car Racing with Deep RL`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/racing-rl): A Deep Q-Learning agent for the CarRacing-v3 environment, using a CNN model with experience replay, frame stacking, and preprocessing. The agent processes raw pixel data to optimize driving actions on a racetrack.
- [`üîó Wikipedia Missing Knowledge Links`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Missing_Knowledge_Links_WIkipedia): A missing link analysis to identify logical but absent connections between Wikipedia pages.
- [`üìà ML Portfolio Creation & Optimization`](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://bsic.it) for ML enabled portfolio creation from the SP500 through. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, confronted minimum variance and minimum entropy portfolio optimization.
- [`üöî Distracted Driving Detection`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Distracted-Driver-Detection): I implemented a hybrid architecture that combines deep learning feature extraction with hyperdimensional computing to achieve robust multiclassification distracted driving detection from images.


#### University Related Projects

- [`‚ö°Ô∏è Hyper-Parameter Optimization`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/parameter_optimization.git): Comparing various hyper-parameter optimization algorithms on kNN and Logistic Regression classifiers.
