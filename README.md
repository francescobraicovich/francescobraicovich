|-----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
|[`üß† ARC with RL (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC.git) | A novel framework to solve ARC-AGI tasks with sequential actions through RL. Created a custom Domain Specific Language, action space and implemented Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for the large combinatorial space.|
| [`üß† ARC with RL (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2.git) | An improvement to v1, implemented learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with pretrained world model to ease action space navigation.|
| `üß† ARC with RL (v3)` | Implementing a Hierarchical World Model for the RL agent to leverage during training and inference.|
| [`üîª Drop-Stochastic Gradient Descent`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/dsgd.git) | A new PyTorch optimizer that stochastically selects which parameters to update at each iteration.|
| [`üåç RL World Models`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/rl-worlds.git) | Evaluating JEPA world model with VICReg against ViT Encoder-Decoder models on RL environments.|
