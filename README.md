## Ciao everyone! 👋
 - I am francesco (braico for friends)
 - I study Maths & CS for AI @ Bocconi University
- I currently am head of research/projects @ [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association)
- I'm passionate about ML & AI, enjoy math, am a football enthusiast, love photography, read The Economist obsessively, and devour podcast

### 📌 Some Relevant Projects 
- [🏎️ Car Racing with Deep RL](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Car-Racing-Deep-RL): I implemented a Deep Q-Learning agent for the CarRacing-v3 environment, using a CNN model with experience replay, frame stacking, and preprocessing. The agent processes raw pixel data to optimize driving actions on a racetrack.
- [🔗 Wikipedia Missing Knowledge Links](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Missing_Knowledge_Links_WIkipedia): I developed a missing link analysis to identify logical but absent connections between Wikipedia pages. This process involves constructing a graph of Wikipedia pages, calculating similarity scores, clustering the graph, and applying machine learning to predict potential missing links.
- [📈 ML Portfolio Creation & Optimization](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://bsic.it) to build a portfolio of stocks from the SP500 through ML. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, confronted minimum variance and minimum entropy portfolio optimization.
