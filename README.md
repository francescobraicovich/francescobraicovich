## Ciao everyone! ðŸ‘‹
I am francesco (braico for friends), a student in mathematics and computing sciences for AI at Bocconi University. 
I currently am head of research/projects @ [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association). 
I am passionate of ML & AI, I enjoy maths, I am a football enthusiast, I take photos, I read obsessively The Economist and am a podcasts devourer.

## Relevant Projects
- [Wikipedia Missing Knowledge Links](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Missing_Knowledge_Links_WIkipedia): This missing link analysis project aims to identify missing links between Wikipedia pages that should logically be connected. The process involves building a graph of Wikipedia pages, computing similarity scores, clustering the graph, and using machine learning to predict potential missing links.
- [ML Portfolio Creation & Optimization](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://bsic.it) to build a portfolio of stocks from the SP500 through ML. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, confronted minimum variance and minimum entropy portfolio optimization.
