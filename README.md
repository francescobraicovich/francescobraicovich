## Ciao everyone! 👋
 - I am francesco (braico for friends)
 - I study Maths & CS for AI @ Bocconi University
- I currently am head of research/projects @ [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association)
- I'm passionate about ML & AI, enjoy math, am a football enthusiast, love photography, read The Economist, and podcast listener.

## 📌 Some Relevant Projects 

#### Research Oriented Projects

- [`🧠 ARC with RL (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC.git)): A novel framework to solve ARC-AGI tasks with sequential actions through RL. Created a custom Domain Specific Language, action space and implemented Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for the large combinatorial space.
- [`🧠 ARC with RL (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2.git)): An improvement to v1, implemented learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with pretrained world model to ease action space navigation.
- [`🧠 ARC with RL (v3)`]: Implementing a Hierarchical World Model for the RL agent to leverage during training and inference.
- [`🔻 Drop-Stochastic Gradient Descent`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/dsgd.git) A new PyTorch optimizer that stochastically selects which parameters to update at each iteration.
- [`🌍 RL World Models`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/rl-worlds.git) Evaluating JEPA world model with VICReg against ViT Encoder-Decoder models on RL environments.

#### Personal ML Projects

- [`🏎️ Car Racing with Deep RL`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/racing-rl): A Deep Q-Learning agent for the CarRacing-v3 environment, using a CNN model with experience replay, frame stacking, and preprocessing. The agent processes raw pixel data to optimize driving actions on a racetrack.
- [`🔗 Wikipedia Missing Knowledge Links`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Missing_Knowledge_Links_WIkipedia): A missing link analysis to identify logical but absent connections between Wikipedia pages.
- [`📈 ML Portfolio Creation & Optimization`](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): Joint project between Hephaestus and [BSIC](https://bsic.it) for ML enabled portfolio creation from the SP500 through. Implemented Principal Feature Analysis (PFA) to reduce dimensionality and XGBoost to select stocks, confronted minimum variance and minimum entropy portfolio optimization.
- [`🚔 Distracted Driving Detection`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Distracted-Driver-Detection): I implemented a hybrid architecture that combines deep learning feature extraction with hyperdimensional computing to achieve robust multiclassification distracted driving detection from images.
