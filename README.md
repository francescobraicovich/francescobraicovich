## Ciao everyone! 👋
- I am francesco (braico for friends)
- I study Maths for AI @ Bocconi University
- I am head of research/projects @ [Hephaestus Applied Artificial Intelligence](https://github.com/Hephaestus-AI-Association)
- Currently trying to wrap my head around how pure RL could solve the [ARC-AGI benchmark](https://arcprize.org). 

## 📌 Some Relevant Projects 

#### Research Oriented Projects

- `🧩 ARC-AGI with Reinforcement Learning`: RL framework for ARC-AGI tasks using sequential actions.
  - [`ARC (v1)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC.git): Custom DSL and action space with Wolpertinger Actor-Critic for large combinatorial domains.  
  - [`ARC (v2)`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/ARC2.git): Added learnable action embeddings and ViT state encoding with a pretrained world model.  
  - `ARC (v3)`: Developing a hierarchical world model for the RL agent.  
- [`💧 Drop-Stochastic Gradient Descent`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/dsgd.git): PyTorch optimizer that randomly selects parameters to update each iteration.  
- [`🌍 RL World Models`](https://github.com/bocconi-narcos/rl-worlds.git): Benchmarking JEPA vs. encoder–decoder world models in RL environments. This is not up to date with recent work.

#### Personal ML Projects

- [`🏎️ Car Racing with Deep RL`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/racing-rl): Deep Q-Learning agent for CarRacing-v3 using a CNN and experience replay.  
- [`🔗 Wikipedia Missing Knowledge Links`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Missing_Knowledge_Links_WIkipedia): Analysis to detect logical but missing links between Wikipedia pages.  
- [`📈 ML Portfolio Creation & Optimization`](https://github.com/BSIC/bsic_hephaestus_paper): SP500 portfolio built with PFA and XGBoost, minimized variance and entropy.  
- [`🚔 Distracted Driving Detection`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/Distracted-Driver-Detection): Hybrid deep learning and hyperdimensional computing model for multiclass distracted driving image classification.  

#### University Related Projects

- [`⚡️ Hyper-Parameter Optimization`](https://github.com/francescobraicovich/parameter_optimization.git): Comparison of hyper-parameter optimization algorithms on kNN and logistic regression classifiers.
